# SBASE-CLIENT
Students' android app for the SBASE examination results management system. This is an alternative for students who don't wan't to use
the web app to check their results. I prefer the webapp client to this android app due to security and functionality reasons and obviously my bad GUI design skills. Check the INFO.txt in the SBASE-WEBAPP repository for more information and usage.
